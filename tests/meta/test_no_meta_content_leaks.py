"""CONTENT leak detector for shipped Markdown.

test_no_meta_leaks.py protects ROUTING: which files ship. This module protects
CONTENT: what a legitimately-shipped Markdown file's prose talks about. A doc
that ships to every consumer must not instruct those consumers to look at a path
only this template repo has (for example `tests/meta/e2e/run_all.sh`).

Scope is plan-driven, not directory-driven: the union of every `.md` file that
compute_propagation_plan() reports for any repo type, resolved back to its
template source. A doc that stops shipping stops being checked, and a newly
shipped doc is covered with no edit here.

FORBIDDEN VOCABULARY -- derived from repolib.model, then pruned. The pruning is
deliberate; do not "helpfully" re-add an excluded entry.

META_DIRS entries EXCLUDED from the content check:
  __pycache__, .git       Generic to every repo. A shipped doc explaining what a
                          clean-up script removes names them legitimately.
  tools                   Ambiguous. ROOT tools/ is template infrastructure, but
                          templates/<type>/tools/ ships to a consumer's tools/,
                          so consumers DO have tools/ and may be told about it
                          (test_no_meta_leaks.py documents the same nuance in
                          TYPED_OVERLAY_ALLOWED_META_DIRS). Resolved by
                          forbidding the specific this-repo-only file
                          tools/detect_repo_type.py while allowing bare tools/.
  docs/active_plans,      Meta for ROUTING only: this repo's own plan files must
  docs/archive            not ship. The FOLDER CONVENTION is consumer-facing and
                          is documented on purpose in docs/REPO_STYLE.md, so
                          naming these paths in prose is correct.

META_FILES is NOT reusable as a content vocabulary. Most of it (README.md,
VERSION, .gitignore, REPO_TYPE, docs/CHANGELOG.md) is "meta" only in the routing
sense -- the propagator must not overwrite a consumer's copy -- and every
consumer HAS those files, so mentioning them in prose is legitimate. Only the
two entries that are genuinely this-repo-only are forbidden here:
propagate_style_guides.py and reset_repo.py.
